My first experience using opencv. I found a similar project (https://github.com/avishah3/AI-Basketball-Shot-Detection-Tracker) that uses machine learning, so I decided to keep this project pretty basic despite knowing there's a better way. This project uses color detection and shape detection only. To find the basketball, it simply finds an orange ball. To find the rim, it simply finds a dark red oval outline.
